# LightShuttle

🚀 LightShuttle is a lightweight, fast, and self-hostable orchestrator for containerized applications, designed as a simple alternative to Kubernetes.

---

## Features

- ⚡ Ultra-fast API based on [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)
- 🐳 Direct control over Docker CLI (no daemon inside)
- 🔥 Open-source, fully self-hostable
- 🛠 Simple REST API (no GraphQL)
- 📈 Metrics ready for Prometheus
- 🧹 Designed for developers: deploy faster, debug easier

---

## Architecture

- **Daemon** (`daemon/`): the core server handling API requests and container orchestration
- **CLI** (`cli/`): command-line tool (WIP)
- **Dashboard** (`dashboard/`): web UI (planned)

---

## Requirements

- Rust (>= 1.76)
- Docker installed and accessible (`docker` CLI must work)
- Linux recommended (tested on Debian 12)

---

## Local development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/LightShuttle/lightshuttle.git
cd lightshuttle

# Install dependencies
cargo install cargo-make

# Build and test
make
```

---

## Docker deployment

You can run LightShuttle directly with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 7878:7878 \
  -e BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7878 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  synarion/lightshuttle:latest
```
Or with Docker Compose :

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Ensure you have Docker installed, and the docker.sock is correctly mounted.

---

## Running the Daemon

```bash
# Build
make

# Launch
cargo run --bin lightshuttle_core
```

By default, the API will be available on [http://127.0.0.1:7878](http://127.0.0.1:7878).

You can override the default address by setting the `BIND_ADDRESS` environment variable:

```bash
BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7878 cargo run --bin lightshuttle_core
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic container lifecycle (create, list, delete, logs)
- [x] Start/Stop containers
- [x] Search containers
- [x] Labels support
- [x] Update/Recreate containers
- [x] Volume mounts support
- [x] Restart policies
- [ ] Full error refinement (Docker exit codes, stderr parsing, etc.)
- [ ] CLI client (`lightshuttle-cli`)
- [ ] Dashboard web UI
- [ ] Authentication & RBAC (API keys, roles)
- [ ] Template system (Helm-light style)
- [ ] Resource limits (CPU/memory)
- [ ] Healthcheck support (probe + restart on failure)
- [ ] Init containers
- [ ] Backup/restore volumes
- [ ] Persistent state (optionally save config / containers to disk)
- [ ] Internal DNS / service discovery
- [ ] Graceful shutdown & signal handling
