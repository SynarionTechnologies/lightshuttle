## [Unreleased]

### Added
- 📈 Prometheus metrics endpoint with basic request and uptime instrumentation
- 🌐 CORS origins configurable via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var; disallowed origins return `403`
- 📝 Documented changelog tracking and feature flag usage in `AGENT.md`
- 📘 OpenAPI docs and Swagger UI covering Apps, Health, Metrics and Version endpoints
- 🆔 Structured `ApiError` responses with per-request trace IDs
- 🌐 `DOCKER_HOST` env var for proxy configuration
- 🛡️ Default seccomp profile embedded in Docker image and applied to containers
- 📚 Proxy usage documented in `docs/SECURITY.md`
- 🧪 Unit and integration tests for CLI root check
- 🧾 Docker publish workflow attaches SBOM and provenance attestations
- 🔐 API key authentication middleware with namespace-based RBAC and audit logging

### Changed
- ⬆️ Updated Docker CLI to version 28.3.3 to include Go stdlib patches addressing CVE-2024-24790
- 🛡️ Swagger UI and OpenAPI routes gated behind the `openapi` feature and disabled in release builds
- 🚫 Daemon and CLI exit if executed as root on Unix; Windows builds skip this check to allow compilation
- 🗜️ Docker image now uses a distroless base and removes build-time tools to reduce attack surface
- 🔐 Warn when API key store is missing or invalid
- 🧹 Avoid `expect` when initializing Prometheus recorder for Clippy compliance

## [0.3.0] – 2025-08-02

### Added
- 📜 Unified JSON error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- ♻️ Routes propagate errors directly and return an empty list when Docker isn't available
- 🧪 Integration test ensuring error messages are included in responses
- 🔒 Secure Docker CLI download using curl with SHA256 verification and documented checksum
- 📦 Limit Tokio features in daemon to runtime, macros, signal, time, net

## [0.2.0] – 2025-05-05

### Added
- 🚀 Support for Docker volumes via `volumes: ["/host:/container"]`
- ♻️ Container recreation (`POST /apps/{name}/recreate`) preserving config (env, ports, labels, volumes, restart policy)
- 🟢 Start / Stop container endpoints (`POST /apps/{name}/start` and `.../stop`)
- 🔍 Search support in `GET /apps?search=...`
- 🏷 Container labels via `labels: { "key": "value" }`
- 🌱 Restart policy support (`always`, `on-failure`, etc.)
- 🧪 Extensive Docker-based integration tests with `DOCKER_TEST=1`

### Changed
- 🧱 Refactored `create_and_run_container` into `ContainerConfig` struct (breaking change for internal API)
- 🧹 Codebase cleaned for Clippy compliance (`-D warnings`)
- 📦 CI enforces fmt + clippy + test

### Fixed
- 🔒 Invalid volume format now correctly returns `400 Bad Request`
- ✅ Recreate now properly handles missing port bindings or empty labels/envs

### Removed
- ❌ Legacy signature for `create_and_run_container` (replaced by struct-based API)
